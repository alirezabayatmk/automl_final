Ranking of the approaches by their priority

1. explore the impact of different fidelities
- downsampling images
- reducing the number of training samples
- reducing the number of epochs
- simpler model architectures
- runtime 
- depth/width of the neural network
- number of cross-validation folds

2. automatically determine the best fidelity
- evaluate each fidelity separately (run multiple times to account for randomness)
- apply a statistical test to determine the best fidelity
- consider the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost
- find the fidelity that achieves a good balance between accuracy and computational cost
- use methods such as Bayesian optimization to find the best fidelity

-> multi-fidelity optimization methods: successive halving, hyperband, BOHB, FABOLAS

3. optimize the HPs of the multi-fidelity method
- from the chosen method, find the best HPs of it using HPO methods (?)

-------------------

1. plotting 
2. multi-fidelity selection (image size, epochs, sampling, number of cross-validation folds)
- mean validation error vs performance improvement rate vs spearman rank correlation
3. Optuna on SMAC
